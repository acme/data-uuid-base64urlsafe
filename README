NAME
    Data::UUID::Base64URLSafe - URL-safe UUIDs

SYNOPSIS
      use Data::UUID::Base64URLSafe;
      my $ug = Data::UUID::Base64URLSafe->new;
      my $uuid = $ug->create_b64_urlsafe;

DESCRIPTION
    Data::UUID creates wonderful Globally/Universally Unique Identifiers
    (GUIDs/UUIDs). This module is a subclass of that module which adds a
    method to get a URL-safe Base64-encoded version of the UUID using
    MIME::Base64::URLSafe. What that means is that you can get a
    22-character UUID string which you can use safely in URLs.
